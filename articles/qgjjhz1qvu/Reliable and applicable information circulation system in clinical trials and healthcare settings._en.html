  Current Issues (Pain Points)
  <br />
  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obtaining Personal Identification and Consent
  (eConsent)
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    In current online medical consultations and remote participation in clinical
    trials, eConsent is used to verify the identity of the individual by
    displaying identification documents such as a driver's license and the
    person's face on a web screen. However, it is difficult to argue that this
    method is appropriate.
  </li>
  <li>
    In face-to-face environments, as opposed to remote environments mentioned
    above, verification of the individual and obtaining consent for various
    scenarios such as medical treatment, hospitalization, surgery, and
    participation in clinical trials are done through signatures on paper
    documents. However, due to the nature of paper media, seamless integration
    and coordination with other actions are not possible.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="h07a2fb8652">
  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utilizing PHR (wearable devices, etc.)
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    In general medical care and clinical trials (DCT), there are difficulties in
    utilizing data from patients (subjects) on wearable devices, among other
    reasons. One of the reasons is the lack of a trusted environment and control
    mechanism, where data can be provided to only those individuals with whom
    the individual has consented.
  </li>
  <li>
    Regarding the above, implementing individual technologies for each wearable
    device would increase operational costs and impose burdens on users
    (patients, subjects, and on-site staff), making it impractical.
  </li>
  <li>
    From the perspective of data integrity, it is necessary to consider
    security, personal authentication, and other factors starting from the
    wearable device as the source of data generation. However, there is
    insufficient technical verification and investigation regarding the
    practicality of utilizing these aspects in real clinical settings and
    clinical trials.
  </li>
</ul>

  What Trusted Web Will Solve
  <br />
  &nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obtaining Personal Identification and
  Consent (eConsent)
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Creating personas, implementing DID, and building a trusted relationship
    with hospital staff (as well as pharmaceutical company/CRO staff) through
    smartphone applications.
  </li>
  <li>
    By pairing with hospital staff (as well as pharmaceutical company/CRO
    staff), the process of identity verification and consent acquisition is
    considered complete. This is achieved by displaying an eDocument on the
    medical institution's device, which includes an eSignature linked to
    personal information through a DID, thereby visualizing the consent
    acquisition process (= eConsent).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="h07a2fb8652">
  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utilizing PHR (wearable devices, etc.)
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    During the pairing process, using DID mapping, multiple wearable devices
    that are identified as being owned by the same entity are seamlessly paired
    with the smartphone, which serves as a hub and implements a DID. After
    pairing, each wearable device can share data within the scope of the consent
    given in step 1 (data is encrypted and can only be accessed by paired
    users). Additional coding is done to specify the range of data sharing and
    provide consent control, in accordance with general medical care or the
    clinical trial protocol.
  </li>
  <li>
    On the smartphone application from step 1, it is also possible to revoke
    consent (terminate the pairing), and data sharing is halted after consent
    revocation.
  </li>
  <li>
    The above steps 1 and 2 are seamlessly implemented, using the initial
    pairing as the touchpoint.
  </li>
</ul>

</p>
<h2 id="h6e3d52e9f9">Consensus building and trace</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    By expressing consent for data sharing with third parties, such as
    physicians, as a touchpoint, a trust relationship (pairing) is established.
    This is seamlessly achieved through DID mapping implemented on edge devices,
    allowing data from multiple devices to be shared within the scope of
    consent. The duration and scope of data sharing are controlled by the data
    subject, and only stakeholders who have established a trust relationship can
    perform signature verification on the data.
  </li>
</ul>

  Business validation (including UX/UI) Development of governance and community
  activities
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    We conducted research on wearable devices compatible with the prototype
    system of this project and carried out the definition of wearable device
    requirements taking into account data integrity considerations.
  </li>
  <li>
    We organized the governance, rules, business feasibility, and the necessity
    of data standardization for the utilization of wearable devices such as PHRs
    in daily medical care and clinical trials through interviews with device
    manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, medical institutions, and the PHR
    service industry association.
  </li>
  <li>
    We conducted implementation tests using the prototype system of this project
    and conducted research on UI/UX.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="hb0e31cbb0a">Achievements</h2>
<p>
  Based on the definition of wearable device requirements, we conducted market
  research and created the result as an output called "Wearable Device List".
  Primarily, wearable devices that fall into the following patterns have been
  introduced to the market, and this project is capable of accommodating each of
  them.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Devices that can implement DID (Decentralized Identifier) on the device
    itself, taking into consideration data integrity.
  </li>
  <li>
    Devices that can retrieve data from cloud servers or other sources through
    APIs (encryption possible using the DID of a smartphone, for example).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  &nbsp;
  <br />
  Based on the results of the validation tests and stakeholder interviews, the
  following achievements have been confirmed:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Based on the clinical trials of DCT (Decentralized Clinical Trial) packages,
    there is a significant demand for them in the future. They can potentially
    address existing challenges such as building trust relationships during data
    provision and operational costs.
  </li>
  <li>
    They provide a user interface and user experience (UI/UX) that is tailored
    to the clinical trial setting, offering easier usability compared to
    existing systems and ensuring a certain level of usefulness.

    However, there are several challenges that need to be addressed. These
    include the stakeholders' understanding of the Trusted Web concept, accuracy
    management and standardization of wearable devices, data format
    standardization, and the need for guidance and guidelines. It is essential
    for the industry as a whole to work on understanding the concept of Trusted
    Web, ensuring data quality and standards, and establishing operational and
    monitoring systems.
