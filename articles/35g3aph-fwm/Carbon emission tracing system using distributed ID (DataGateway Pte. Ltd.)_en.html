      Through the demonstration, it was found that the combination with
      decentralized storage is more advantageous than the combination with
      blockchain in terms of loss tolerance and security for proving
      non-falsification data.
    </span>

  <li>
    <span style="color: #1d1c1d">
      By combination of distributed ID and ZKP(zero-knowledge proof)/secure
      computation, personal privacy information and organizational confidential
      information are accurately recorded, computed, and visualized without the
      risk of falsification, while still being protected. Since data is used in
      encrypted form, data handling is secure even across multiple organizations
      and companies, enabling even companies that were previously reluctant to
      participate in greenhouse gas tracing to participate.

      Now that we have demonstrated this as an implemented form of credible
      primary data in the GHG protocol*, we were able to begin working with
      industry associations to encourage international standardization of this
      format.* GHG protocol: standard for calculation of GHG (green house gas)
      emission and its report
