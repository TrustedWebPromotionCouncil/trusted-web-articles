    ■Spoofing of applicants and falsification of application contents
  </span>
  <br />
  <span style="color: black">
    In order to check for applicant impersonation, the issuer of the application
    documents is verified by VC signature verification. Specifically, all the
    VCs received by the Benefits Execution Office are verified by EdDSA1
    signatures.
  </span>
  <br />
  <span style="color: black">
    In addition, the interactions between each entity other than the VC are
    verified by JWS2 signatures. Signature verification enables us to check
    where the issuing authority is and whether the contents have been tampered
    with, thus expanding the area that can be verified.

<ul>
  <li>
    <span style="color: black">
      In a technical study to digitize the conventional grant and benefit
      application process through a mechanism utilizing the Trusted Web,
      identification and proof of existence, which had previously been done by
      attaching paper certificates or scanned data, was implemented by verifying
      the EdDSA signatures on the Residence Certificate VC, Account Existence
      Certificate VC, and Tax Payment Certificate VC.&nbsp;As a result, we
      successfully confirmed that the issuing authority and contents of the VC
      had not been falsified, and confirmed that the implementation was
      technically feasible. Necessity to consider more efficient ways such as
      remote identification and linkage with existing KYC method including
      private service was confirmed.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="color: black">
      To study business models, based on results from interview with
      stakeholders, we propose following:①Pros and Cons of digital certification
      (reducing cost and increasing burden of system operation) 　②Benefits such
      as certifier’s income from service fee③Importance of the efforts to create
      an ecosystem and the cost of transition from an analog (paper)-based
      world.
