<h2 id="h3de38f0a83">&nbsp;Current issues and What Trusted Web Solves</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="hf497d6bebc">Current Issues (Pain Points)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The secretariat of subsidy projects, etc. uses the current status and public
    information in KYC/KYB operations needed for checking the actual activities
    of small businesses (including sole proprietors) and impersonation by
    malicious third parties. There are limits to the coverage and freshness of
    such attribute information, however, there is little information that can be
    obtained that can be used smoothly in business, creating obstacles to
    improving the level of confirmation.
  </li>
  <li>
    There are many types of related documents, data cannot be standardized, and
    digital methods that are easy for small and medium-sized enterprises to
    adopt from the viewpoint of information literacy and UI/UX have not yet been
    developed and spread. This means that there are a limited number of
    documents that can be obtained and submitted in readable formats, which
    hinders the efficiency of operations, including automatic verification.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hf98e983a74">What Trusted Web Will Solve</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    &nbsp;By expanding verifiability based on the concept of Trusted Web and
    through the social implementation of a system that allows a certain level of
    reliance for business purposes, the Verifiable Identity Community related to
    KYC/KYB of business operators will be able to collect related documents,
    etc. (i.e, data). This will allow use of KYC/KYB information generated from
    the business activities of private businesses (or other ministries,
    agencies, local governments) whose information has not been previously used
    in applications for subsidy payments. Through this, information related to
    the identity of the person can be utilized, and as a result, the level of
    confirmation performed by secretariats of subsidy projects, etc. to prevent
    inappropriate use will be improved.
  </li>
  <li>
    Utilizing technical elements used in Trusted Web, establishing
    infrastructure such as business digital identity wallets and portal
    functions as UI/UX, we will realize operational efficiency through automatic
    verification processing, etc.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hbc71db4759">Data to be verified</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Information that is “in a state where a certain level of reliability cannot
    be guaranteed for the purpose of business” has low reliability value as
    “reference information” for business decisions in the business operations of
    secretariats of subsidy projects, etc., and is difficult to use effectively.
  </li>
  <li>
    Regarding KYB of businesses (including sole proprietors), it is difficult to
    grasp the actual situation by simply checking specific evidence or referring
    to databases, etc. We aim to improve reliability by making composite
    judgments on data).
  </li>

  Issues/ arguments/ To-Be consideration Desk business feasibility study
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Identification of issues in the secretariat of subsidy projects, etc. (not
    just identification of obvious issues through analysis of the current
    situation, but also identification of impediments and issues to be solved
    centered on TO BE goals), consideration of TO BE, and organization of
    issues.
  </li>
  <li>
    A desktop feasibility study based on consideration of scenario hypotheses in
    prototype system planning and exchange of opinions with business operators,
    etc. who are candidates for certificate issuers.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h42263099bd">Main Achievements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Ways in which the social implementation of Trusted Web in administrative
    procedures (particularly subsidy projects, etc.) is likely to contribute to
    further improvements in "deterring inappropriate use" and "promoting
    digitization of related documents, etc." (the worldview that we ultimately
    aim for), and the mechanisms that need to be considered (governance
    perspective, system perspective).
  </li>
  <li>
    Recommendations for establishing the foundation of administrative procedures
    in society (making it a social infrastructure), with the possibility of
    contributing to the private business environment in mind.
  </li>
  <li>
    From next fiscal year onward, we will identify required functions, consider
    flow diagrams, system overview diagrams, UI/UX images, etc., as the
    requirements definition for prototype system planning, which will serve as
    an opportunity for consideration of demonstration experiments in one of the
    ministries and agencies.
