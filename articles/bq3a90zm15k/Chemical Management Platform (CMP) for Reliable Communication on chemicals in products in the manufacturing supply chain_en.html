  Current issues and What Trusted Web Solves
</h2>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="hf497d6bebc">Current Issues (Pain Points)</h3>
<p>
  Information is transmitted in the form and substance list of each industry of
  electrical, electronic, and automobile, and requests and answers are made by
  e-mail, which puts a heavy load on the entire supply chain.
  <br />
  Because the protection and scope of disclosure of trade secret information
  (CBI) cannot be controlled by each company, individual inquiries and leakage
  of chemical substance information occur, and information accuracy is low.
  <br />
  Information in the supply chain is interrupted Therefore, information
  corresponding to legal and regulatory changes and 4M changes is not
  transmitted, and information cannot be traced.

<h3 id="hf98e983a74">What Trusted Web Will Solve</h3>
<p>
  The improvement of trust and identity management among B2Bs in the blockchain
  will enable the exchange of information for the management of chemicals
  contained in products common to the industry using the information platform.
  <br />
  The B2B is configured as an identity graph, and the chemical substance
  information contained in the product can be used as verifiable data to realize
  CBI protection of the entire supply chain and control of the disclosure range.
  <br />
  The CMP Consortium will operate the list of common substances and APIs used by
  each company, and will assume overall governance and build an ecosystem in
  which companies and vendors can easily participate.

<h2 id="hae9a22ed80">Development of governance and community activities</h2>
<h3 id="hde04f7616f">Governance</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Although the scope of implementation of the platform's functions is greater
    than that of conventional chemical substance information transmission
    schemes, in order for various companies involved in the supply chain to use
    CMP to exchange information, rules for its use are deemed necessary, and we
    have reviewed them.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h6207e594ba">Community</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Important for the platform to be used throughout the supply chain. In
    addition to technical considerations, we believe it is necessary to
    understand the needs of the supply chain and incorporate them into the
    system functions in a balanced manner.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="h637afe3e83">Major results</h2>
<h3 id="hde04f7616f">Governance</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The detailed functions of the platform have not been determined, but in
    parallel with the examination of the system, the preparation and examination
    were started by referring to the "usage rules" such as chemSHERPA, an
    existing information transmission scheme.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="h6207e594ba">Community</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The group of voluntary companies that consider CMP is itself becoming an
    important core of community formation. Midstream companies and small and
    medium-sized enterprise (SME), which were not numerous at the proposal
    stage, are now participating in the discussions, and the membership is
    becoming more balanced in terms of upstream, midstream, and downstream
    companies in the supply chain, as well as in terms of company size.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    From now on, the companies participating in the task force will be the first
    to inform and deploy the system in the supply chain, and the study and
    operation will be promoted so that communities can be formed autonomously.
  </li>
