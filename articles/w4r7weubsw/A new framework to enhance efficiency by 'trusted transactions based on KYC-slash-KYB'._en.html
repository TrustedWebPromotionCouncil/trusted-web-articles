  This page shows the " A new framework to enhance efficiency by 'trusted
  transactions based on KYC/KYB'" explored and tested by DENTSU SOKEN INC., in
  the 2023 "Use Case Demonstration Project of the Trusted Web".
  <br />
  &nbsp;
  <br />
  Please click on the links at the bottom of this page to learn more about the
  details of the demonstration.
  <br />
  <br />
  At present, paper applications and verification works related to personal
  identification are still the standard practice. Trusted Web enables the
  issuance of VC for KYC/KYB, allowing for the reuse of identity verification
  data and digital verification. This advancement facilitates the adoption of
  trusted transactions, leading to an expected acceleration of trust-based
  transactions.

<h2 id="habf2314fa9">Current issues and What Trusted Web Solves</h2>
<h3 id="hf497d6bebc">Current Issues (Pain Points)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Holder is required to register corporate information such as the company
    name and primary business location with various government agencies. Each
    time they apply for something, they must register their business location
    information again.
  </li>
  <li>
    Verifier receives application information from the Holder and obtains
    necessary information for transactions from Issuers, which can be public or
    private organizations. Due to variations in the sources of proof and
    acquisition procedures, the process is complex and time-consuming.
  </li>
  <li>
    In addition to verifying the Holder (corporate entity), Verifier also needs
    to conduct identity verification (KYC) for beneficial owners applying
    separately.
  </li>
</ul>

</p>
<h3 id="hf98e983a74">What Trusted Web Will Solve</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Issuer conducts KYC and KYB based on Holder's request and issues VC for KYC
    and KYB. Holder presents the VC for KYC/KYB to Verifier as a VP and applies
    for transactions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Potential VCs that may facilitate trusted transactions are organized, and
    discussions with issuing entities and companies in need are conducted.
  </li>
  <li>
    A prototype system is developed for the purpose of extracting challenges
    when applying Trusted Web to business processes, and hearings using demo
    screens are conducted.
  </li>
  <li>
    Contributions are made to the implementation aspect of the OpenID4VC family
    specifications. Additionally, implementation from VC issuance to
    presentation based on the latest specifications is carried out.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong style="color: #c45911">
    <u>
      ⇒By ensuring KYC/KYB, Trusted Web's social implementation is brought
      closer to reality, and challenges in applying business processes are
      addressed.

<h2 id="h9381155d57">Verification Data</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    In this project, we focused on the use case of opening corporate accounts at
    financial institutions. We conducted verification from the perspective of
    business feasibility and the utilization of identity and business
    information through Trusted Web, as well as the digitization of verification
    for efficiency improvement, particularly focusing on the feasibility of
    personal verification VC.
  </li>
  <li>
    On the technical side, we implemented the exchange of VCs using the OID4VC
    family and verified wallet secret key management using the Threshold ECDSA
    Signature API.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the table below was conducted with the cooperation of Dentsusoken, as
    well as ACSiON, Authlete, and other entities involved in this project.
