  <span style="color: black">
    During the demonstration period, we conducted a field test of the prototype
    system between the actual medical institution network and our network with
    Souseikai Global Clinical Research Center (Souseikai). In addition, we
    conducted interviews with internal and external experts and stakeholders.
    The results, suggestions, and comments obtained from these field tests and
    interviews are as follows.

      (Results) The field test was completed without any problems, and the
      expected behavior and effects were confirmed. (Comments/Implications)
      Souseikai's reaction was that they would like to introduce the system to
      clinical studies and epidemiological studies conducted by medical
      institutions and academia, which require low-cost planning and
      implementation and currently do not guarantee data integrity. The
      possibility of implementing a low-cost model for trials and studies that
      require a large amount of money for implementation was suggested by
      simplifying the content of work within the process without making major
      changes to the existing process itself.

      (Comment)&nbsp;We feel that the architecture of the prototype system and
      the benefits obtained from it will be an example of what the future should
      look like. On the other hand, we feel that it is over-engineered compared
      to the concept of data integrity currently required in the medical field
      and the clinical trial. Therefore, we feel that activities to disseminate
      the architecture of this prototype system, and the technical requirements
      required in the Trusted Web white paper to society as a whole are
      necessary.&nbsp;
