<p>
  "Digital advertisement is riddled with flaws, giving path to dubious avenues
  of profit". A former operator of a “manga" piracy site was quoted on a
  Japanese newspaper*, showing how the digital advertising system still remains
  unreliable to this day. This shortcoming comes from the lack of methods to
  verify metadata confirming the trustworthiness of media and platform operators
  where digital ads are displayed, thus hindering secure advertising
  transactions. (*ref. The Yomiuri Shimbun 2023.9.20 morning edition)
  <br />
  OP is a technology to embed information as verifiable data that will
  contribute to allowing the internet user to be able to judge the “originator”
  of the content and verify its credibility. This technology will improve the
  current digital advertising business model on the internet by enabling
  verification-based advertising transactions.

  Key points of verification: To verify the authenticity of site operators and
  advertisers in digital advertising transactions
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Advertisers and media both obtain an OP ID, and include their ID during
    programmatic ad transactions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Advertisers and media both verify their transaction partners by confirming
    the match between each other's OP ID and the Signed OP (SOP) contained in
    the Site/Ad Profile Pair.
  </li>
  <li>
    The SOP also includes authentication information from third-party
    verification agencies, allowing for verification of the reliability of the
    counterparty.
  </li>
  <li>
    SOP/SDP complies to VC standards, eliminating the need for communication
    with OP/DP registries each time there is a transaction.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h96668290fe">Development of Governance</h2>
<p>
  OP is a technology that enables the verification of the authenticity of
  content issuers.There were high expectations for its reliability so an
  external expert panel was established primarily to discuss the following
  points:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>OP's role in solving issues in the internet space.</li>
  <li>
    What OP users are required to do and their commitment to information
    dissemination in the internet.
  </li>
  <li>Response to violations and malicious use.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h42263099bd">Main Achievements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    We have confirmed that the programmatic ad transactions were made after
    users used their OP ID to authorize the OP ID of the counterparty.
  </li>
  <li>
    Using the browser extension, users can check the information about media and
    advertisers stored in the registry.
  </li>
  <li>
    Through the three meetings of outside experts, discussions progressed on the
    OP's basic principles and what it asks of its users.
  </li>
  <li>
    Media, advertisers, certification organizations, and many other companies
    participated in the experiment.
  </li>
</ul>
