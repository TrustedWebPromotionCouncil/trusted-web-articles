      By having other people who can be trusted prove the specific contents and
      abilities of individual courses that are difficult to prove, students'
      achievements can be accurately linked to the company. As a result, it
      becomes possible to provide the optimum employment support for each
      individual.

      It has become possible to prove the academic achievement and ability of
      other than the result evaluation (volunteer activity and club activity)
      which was difficult to prove in the job hunting until now.

      It has been found that social needs are higher for certifications related
      to activities and skills that are not yet systematized, rather than
      certificates such as transcripts, which are already issued as papers.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="color: black">
      With regard to the granularity of registering activities and skills
      adopted in this demonstration, it was demonstrated that students could
      easily register and evaluate activities and skills without hesitation, and
      that they could appropriately select activities and skills to submit to
      companies.
