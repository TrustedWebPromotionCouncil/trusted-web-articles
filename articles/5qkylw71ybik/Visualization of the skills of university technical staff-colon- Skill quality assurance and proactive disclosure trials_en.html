    To help solve problems by controlling the scope of disclosure and access to
    own attribute information. In addition, by being able to track whether the
    attribute information provided is handled within the agreed scope (Period,
    Recipient), it is possible to take the initiative without leaving
    information management.
  </li>
  <li>
    By having trusted others prove skills and experiences that are difficult to
    prove quantitatively, we will contribute to joint research and the creation
    of new projects with local communities that have never occurred before, and
    to the revitalization of local economies.

<h3 id="hd270818dfb">Incumbent university</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    By having a trusted person prove specific skills and experience that are
    difficult to prove, the information of technical staff can be accurately
    linked to the project target. This will enable the effective use of campus
    seeds for new collaborative research, support and matching.

    When the issuer of the attribute information is signed and made into an
    electronic certificate, it is possible to confirm whether or not the
    presented information is tampered with and whether it is credible. If the
    declaration information is certified by a trusted person, the burden of
    evaluation on the project destination can be reduced and matching with
    higher accuracy can be achieved.

  Development of governance and community activities
</h2>
<p>
  In this demonstration, the following points of view were grasped and arranged.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Expectations in the utilization of technical staff and project formation at
    both universities and companies
  </li>
  <li>
    System for identifying and evaluating skills in highly specialized jobs in
    the process of guaranteeing the quality of skills
  </li>
  <li>
    Organizing the duties and skills of technical staff for data standardization
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h42263099bd">Main Achievements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    The expectations of universities and companies were clarified through
    hearings. Universities are expected to utilize technical staff throughout
    the organization, and will promote the exchange of information and skill
    development with other universities. On the corporate side, technical staff
    work independently, making it easier for companies to achieve desired
    results (Starting new businesses and improving efficiency).
  </li>
  <li>
    Efforts were made to standardize the skill catalog, and the purpose and
    significance were shared among stakeholders. Specifically, the team worked
    with the University of the Ryukyus to create and evaluate a skill catalog
    and skill map for specific fields. It also worked with Council of Research
    Infrastructures and Research Environment* to discuss processes, governance
    and business models. This demonstration project was introduced to other
    universities and gained their understanding, and there was a growing
    movement to develop skills cataloging and standardization.
