<ul>
  <li>
    <strong style="color: red">
      <u>
        Training institutions are unable to verify the effectiveness of
        education
      </u>
    </strong>
    <strong><u></u></strong>
    because they are unable to ascertain the work history that their trained
    talent accumulated while abroad.
  </li>
  <li>
    The rapid depreciation of the yen, rising wages for workers in developed
    countries
    <strong style="color: red">
      <u>make overseas recruitment more difficult.</u>
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    Foreign talent explains their backgrounds through self-reports such as
    resumes,
    <strong style="color: red">
      <u>
        but it is difficult to prove their abilities in a highly objective
        manner.
      </u>
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    When a citizen moves out of their country, the sending country has no medium
    for recording the history of their activities outside the country.&nbsp;This
    makes it difficult to ascertain what they have done and
    <span style="color: red"></span>
    <strong style="color: red">
      <u>will not lead to policy being made.</u>
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    Agents (employment support and capability assessment) require significant
    man-hours to obtain/understand information on talent,
    <span style="color: red"></span>
    <strong style="color: red">
      <u>increasing the cost of matching and other operations.</u>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong style="color: #00b0f0">
      <u>
        A system is established to verify and authenticate person’s identity by
        utilizing certificates issued by each stakeholder as authenticated
        credentials.
      </u>
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    A personal information distribution system that enables third-party
    verification even across borders can be formed by issuing a certificate of
    evaluation and performance to foreign talent in advance from third-party
    organizations that can verify their academic, professional, and skill
    history, such as training institutions, host institutions, and other
    evaluation organizations.
  </li>
  <li>
    &nbsp;By certifying career information and increasing transparency in the
    return flow of foreign talent (before entry into Japan, while in Japan, and
    after returning home), this will
    <strong style="color: #00b0f0">
      <u>
        revitalize the recruitment market for foreign talent, which has been
        less mobile up until now, and furthermore, improve the attractiveness of
        host institutions issuing certificates, thereby accelerating the
        mobility of foreign talent.

  Business Validation (including UX/UI) and Implemented Technology
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Interviews and questionnaires were conducted with each stakeholder regarding
    the needs and usage scenarios for certificates of employment history and
    Japanese language skills, and the business feasibility study was a
    particular focus of the project.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h42263099bd">Main Achievements</h2>
<h3 id="h2761d20679">Proof of abilities that are difficult to prove</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    By having a trusted third party certify Japanese language skills and career
    history that are difficult for foreign workers to prove on their own, it is
    possible to accurately link proof of ability to companies. This has proven
    to be an effective way to optimize individualized employment support and
    reduce hiring mismatches.
  </li>
  <li>
    On the other hand, there is a need for foreign workers to select only the
    information that is convenient for them and submit it to companies, and a
    selective disclosure function is necessary to achieve this, but at present
    the technology to achieve this has not been selected, which will be a future
    issue.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h605c4e040e">Consideration of business models</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    It was found that career certificates can be a motivating factor for
    overseas personnel to work, a decision-making factor for acceptance of
    employment, and a decision-making factor for referrals. It was also
    confirmed that there are advantages to issuing the certificate not only for
    the overseas personnel but also for the companies that accept overseas
    personnel.
  </li>
  <li>
    Future issues include the development of data utilization processes and rule
    governance for the utilization of certificates on the sending country side.
    Policy support from the Japanese government and other government agencies
    will be necessary in seeking continuous dialogue and cooperation with
    overseas government agencies and educational institutions.
