  <strong><u>Business Description</u></strong>
</h2>
<p>
  The project “Business Unit Identity and its Digital Certification Platform”
  aims to improve the trustworthiness of cross-industry and cross-border supply
  chain information by using a business unit ID to guarantee the existence of
  business units and the authenticity of the digital information that passes
  between them.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Business Unit ID
    <ul>
      <li>
        Refers to a digital certificate that verifies the identity of the
        Business Unit.
      </li>
      <li>
        This digital certificate, linked to the Decentralized Identifier (DID)
        created by the Holder, is a verifiable digital certificate digitally
        signed by a trusted third party, a.k.a. Verifiable Credentials (VC).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Digital Certification Platform
    <ul>
      <li>
        In this pilot project, Digital Certificate Organizations are
        hypothetically approved as trusted third parties by the Accreditation
        Organization. They issue digital certificates (VC) as proof of
        certification.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Digital Certificate Organization issues, renews and revokes Business
        Unit IDs for Business Units.
      </li>
      <li>
        Accreditation Organizations, Digital Certificate Organizations and their
        functions are collectively referred to as the “Digital Certification
        Platform.”
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Business Unit
    <ul>
      <li>
        Applies for issuance of Business Unit ID from the Digital Certificate
        Organization.
      </li>
      <li>
        By encapsulating data such as product information found in existing
        systems inside the Business Unit’s Verifiable Presentation (VP), we can
        verify the trustworthiness of such data.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  &nbsp;(Note) Definition of Business Unit VP in this Pilot
</h4>
<p>
  The Verifiable Presentation (VP) issued by the Business Unit refers to a set
  of digital certificates containing the Business Unit VC and information it
  wants to prove the authenticity on (assumed to be converted into a VC) .
  <br />
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="h9d477c006a"><strong>Social and Economic Value</strong></h3>
<p>
  In rules proposed one after another, such as the EU Battery Regulation led by
  the EU and the draft of the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation
  (ESPR), along with the Digital Product Passport (DPP), demands for the
  trustworthiness of supply chains, products, and services are increasingly
  growing.
  <br />
  The mechanisms proposed in this pilot project, along with the concurrent
  international standardization efforts, aim to reduce the time and cost
  required for compliance and verification of these regulations. It is expected
  that this will ensure the authenticity of product components (such as BOM
  information) and information related to quality assurance.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Social Value
    <ul>
      <li>
        Guarantee of authenticity of digital information exchanges between
        Business Units
      </li>
      <li>
        Improvement of trustworthiness of cross-industry, cross-sector and
        cross-border supply chains.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Elimination of counterfeit goods</li>
  <li>
    Economic Value
    <ul>
      <li>Reduction in costs of ensuring trustworthiness</li>
      <li>
        Reduction in countermeasure costs and damages in the event of tampered
        information or the inclusion of counterfeit goods
      </li>
    </ul>

  <strong><u>Materials related to the Use Cases</u></strong>
</h2>
<p>
  ■　Case 1 (On-Boarding)
  <br />
  When entering into a new contract with a business partner, create a VP
  containing the Business Unit ID and the contract. The counterparty can confirm
  the authenticity by verifying the VP (confirmation of the certificate) without
  separately conducting Due Diligence (DD) on the business unit.
  <br />
  <br />

    alt=""
  />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  ■　Case 2 (On-Going)
  <br />
  When ICT manufacturers purchase products such as network equipments from
  multiple suppliers (including overseas), the supplier creates a VP containing
  the product’s VC and the business unit ID (to prove the product’s
  manufacturer). The buyer can confirm the authenticity of the product through
  verifying the VP (confirmation of the certificate).
