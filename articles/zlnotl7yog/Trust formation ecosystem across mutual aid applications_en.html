  Demonstration Project of the Trusted Web".

<h2 id="habf2314fa9">Current issues and What Trusted Web Solves</h2>
<h3 id="hf497d6bebc">Current Issues (Pain Points)</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    While trust verification is important for mutual aid applications to avoid
    problems, there are issues such as compatibility with privacy and increased
    hassle of registering user information.
  </li>
  <li>
    Apps are offering supporter’s user profile and linking with SNS to enhance
    their trust. However, the system cannot prove the authenticity of such
    self-reporting data.
  </li>
  <li>
    User rating can be used for trust verification. However, as some mutual help
    apps have small number of users, such app alone cannot provide sufficient
    rating data.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  <br />
  Mutual help achievement data is not accumulated→Unable to verify trust within
  mutual help app→Users cannot use app with confidence→does not increase users.
  Such a vicious circle can lead to withdrawal from the business.

<h3 id="hf98e983a74">What Trusted Web Will Solve</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Users can manage their own data and provide it to the third party while
    protecting their privacy. Through this the scope of trust verification may
    be enhanced than ever.
  </li>
  <li>
    Allows users to present their own data to third parties, potentially
    increasing the scope of trust validation without significantly increasing
    the need for privacy-conscious information entry.
  </li>
  <li>
    By linking information across more than 300 sharing services, including
    mutual aid applications, mutual aid achievements from other applications can
    be accumulated and used for trust verification. In addition, by making the
    system capable of verifying mutual aid achievements in university entrance
    examinations and job searches, it will lead to stronger incentives for
    mutual aid app supporters.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  &nbsp;
  <br />
  Building an ecosystem with centralized database that links relevant
  information from all mutual help apps is not feasible. We studied method for
  sharing the mutual help achievement data by using distributed ID system
  technology as Verifiable Credential（VC）
  <br />

<h2 id="hbc71db4759">Data to be verified</h2>
<p>
  To issue a digital certificate of the activity results in the Mutual Aid App
  and to improve the trust of the supporter, the authenticity of the results is
  verified by the signature verification of the VC. The VC of a supporter issued
  by Mutual Aid App A is verified by another Mutual Aid App B according to the
  use case.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><u>【Use Case 1】 Trusted Profile</u></li>
</ul>
<p>
  The scope of trust verification for online profiles can be expanded by linking
  digital certificates whose issuers are trusted.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><u>【Use Case 2】 Incentives from beverage manufacturers</u></li>
</ul>
<p>
  Easy coordination of mutual aid performance to third-party firms can increase
  incentive creation opportunities and stakeholders.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><u>【Use Case 3】 Nursery School Application Use Case</u></li>
</ul>
<p>
  The program will be used to add points to the adjustment index for preschool
  applications, thereby providing incentives for community activities and
  streamlining the online application process.

<h2 id="hae9a22ed80">Development of governance and community activities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    A trust framework was developed that could be agreed upon among multiple
    stakeholders, with reference to prior accreditation systems.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="hcaec501c64">Business validation (including UX/UI)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    We discussed with the mutual aid application vendor how to display and link
    mutual aid achievements, including the creation of a demo screen for Wallet,
    which accumulates mutual aid achievements, and examined ways to promote the
    benefits through a more intuitive user experience.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h42263099bd">Main Achievements</h2>
<p>Governance Formulation</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The necessary items for the trust framework were organized and a document
    for the Mutual Aid Trust Framework was developed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Discussions were held with experts based on the formulated document, and
    responsibility breakdown points for each stakeholder were organized.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Business validation (including UX/UI)</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Examined customer experience use cases that would improve the trust scope by
    leveraging mutual aid achievements.
  </li>
  <li>
    Created mockups of the examined use cases and conducted UI/UX research
    through user interviews.
  </li>
</ul>
