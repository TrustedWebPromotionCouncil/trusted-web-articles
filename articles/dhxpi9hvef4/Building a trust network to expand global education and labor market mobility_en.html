<h2 id="habf2314fa9">Current issues and What Trusted Web Solves</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="hf497d6bebc">Current Issues (Pain Points)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Difficult to confirm that education is being provided in accordance with
    labor market requirements.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unclear security management of personal information and difficulty in
    centralized management of learning data.
  </li>
  <li>
    Management of personal information is complicated, and data acquisition of
    overseas human resources requires compliance with personal information
    protection regulations.
  </li>
  <li>
    As international matching of human resources progresses and each country
    defines different personal information protection regulations, it is
    difficult to ensure substantial compliance.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hf98e983a74">What Trusted Web Will Solve</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Implement a system that enables the sharing of personal competence data
    worldwide while keeping learning data confidential, so that education can be
    provided according to market needs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Establish a system that allows candidates to take charge of their own data
    management.
  </li>
  <li>
    Establish a system that enables matching of talent data in encrypted form to
    reduce unnecessary data management.
  </li>
  <li>
    Establish a system to encrypt personal data for international data transfer
    while complying with national privacy regulations.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hcc8ea8ce34">Verification Points</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Create 8 levels of skill data based on ESCO standards, which are
    increasingly utilized internationally.
  </li>
  <li>
    Calculate the talent’s skill data by multiplying encrypted learning data and
    its weight for each via secure computation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Store divided and encrypted learning date in BC and RDB to ensure its
    authenticity and the talent’s right of deleting it.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h67d702afdf">Business and Operational Validation (including UX/UI)</h2>
<p>The following are the particular aspects that were focused on in PoC.</p>
<ul>
  <li>What abilities should employers expect from job talents?</li>
  <li>
    How should a smooth UX/UI be designed for recruiters, especially when hiring
    international talents?
  </li>
  <li>
    How should the matching of talents with employers be achieved while keeping
    their learning data confidential?
  </li>
  <li>
    How can talents control their own data such as disclosing and deleting their
    learning data without relying on the platform?
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h42263099bd">Main Achievements</h2>
<p>The main results from the PoC are as follows.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Developed a secure architecture where only job seekers manage keys for their
    data, preventing unauthorized decryption.
  </li>
  <li>
    Employed lattice cryptography for encrypting learning data and company
    weights, ensuring quantum-resistant operations in Lattigo with the CKKS
    scheme.
  </li>
  <li>
    Created a scatter plot for efficient matching, with talents' desired
    salaries and encrypted skill data calculated via secret computation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Designed a system for personal data management using distributed technology,
    allowing data encryption and storage split between blockchain and databases.
  </li>
  <li>
    Received feedback from companies on courses for Vietnamese students and
    skill data, noting some gaps in information for hiring.
  </li>
</ul>
